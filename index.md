## Under Construction....

## ToDo:
- ~~resize the embedded images to appropriate resolution (to reduce file size), try 640x800~~
- ~~make folium iFrame load dynamically image file from repo folder instead of embedding images as base64 string~~
- use quiver as markers on map
- optimize rose graph layout (common legend, scale, color scale...)
